Implementation Plan - Hues and Cues Online Game

Problem Statement:
Build a digital online implementation of Hues and Cues party game using AWS serverless architecture, extending the existing color board interface with real-time multiplayer functionality.

Requirements:
- Full AWS serverless stack (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB + WebSocket API)
- AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- Real-time multiplayer game rooms (3-10 players)
- Turn-based clue giving and color guessing
- Proximity-based scoring system
- Quick prototype focused on core gameplay

Background:
- Existing color board UI with 4x30 grid and selection functionality
- Game involves clue-giver providing 1-2 word hints, others placing cubes on matching colors
- Scoring: 3 points exact match, 1 point adjacent, clue-giver gets 1 point per correct guess
- Need real-time updates for cube placement and turn management

Proposed Solution:
AWS serverless architecture with CDK deployment, extending existing frontend with WebSocket integration for real-time gameplay.

Task Breakdown:

Task 1: Set up CDK infrastructure foundation
- Initialize CDK project with TypeScript
- Define DynamoDB tables for games, players, and moves
- Create API Gateway REST API for game management
- Demo: CDK can deploy basic infrastructure stack

Task 2: Implement core Lambda functions
- Create game room (POST /games)
- Join game room (POST /games/{gameId}/join)
- Get game state (GET /games/{gameId})
- Basic game state management in DynamoDB
- Demo: Can create and join game rooms via REST API

Task 3: Add WebSocket API for real-time updates
- WebSocket API Gateway with connect/disconnect handlers
- Connection management in DynamoDB
- Broadcast system for game state updates
- Demo: Real-time connection and basic message broadcasting

Task 4: Implement game logic Lambda functions
- Start game and turn management
- Submit clue (clue-giver phase)
- Place cube (guessing phase)
- Calculate scores based on proximity
- Demo: Complete turn cycle with scoring

Task 5: Integrate frontend with backend
- Extend existing HTML/JS with WebSocket client
- Add game room UI (create/join)
- Real-time board updates and turn indicators
- Player list and score display
- Demo: Full playable game with multiple browser tabs
